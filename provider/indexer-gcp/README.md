## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

# Configuration

## Service Configuration
### Anthos:
[Anthos service configuration ](docs/anthos/README.md)
### GCP:
[Gcp service configuration ](docs/gcp/README.md)

## Mappers

This is a universal solution created using EPAM OQM mappers technology. It allows you to work with various
implementations of message brokers.

For more information about mappers:
- [OQM Readme](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/platform/system/lib/cloud/gcp/oqm/-/blob/master/README.md)

### Limitations of the current version

In the current version, the mappers are equipped with several drivers to the stores and the message broker:

- OQM (mapper to message brokers): Google PubSub; RabbitMQ

## Settings and Configuration

### Prerequisites
1. Mandatory
  - JDK 8
  - Lombok 1.16 or later
  - Maven
2. For Google Cloud only
  - GCloud SDK with java (latest version)

### Anthos Service Configuration:
[Anthos service configuration ](docs/anthos/README.md)
### GCP Service Configuration:
[Gcp service configuration ](docs/gcp/README.md)

## Run service

### Run Locally
Check that maven is installed:

```bash
$ mvn --version
Apache Maven 3.6.0
Maven home: /usr/share/maven
Java version: 1.8.0_212, vendor: AdoptOpenJDK, runtime: /usr/lib/jvm/jdk8u212-b04/jre
...
```

You may need to configure access to the remote maven repository that holds the OSDU dependencies. This file should live within `~/.mvn/community-maven.settings.xml`:

```bash
$ cat ~/.m2/settings.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>community-maven-via-private-token</id>
            <!-- Treat this auth token like a password. Do not share it with anyone, including Microsoft support. -->
            <!-- The generated token expires on or before 11/14/2019 -->
             <configuration>
              <httpHeaders>
                  <property>
                      <name>Private-Token</name>
                      <value>${env.COMMUNITY_MAVEN_TOKEN}</value>
                  </property>
              </httpHeaders>
             </configuration>
        </server>
    </servers>
</settings>
```

* Update the Google cloud SDK to the latest version:

```bash
gcloud components update
```
* Set Google Project Id:

```bash
gcloud config set project <YOUR-PROJECT-ID>
```

* Perform a basic authentication in the selected project:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

* Navigate to indexer service's root folder and run:

```bash
mvn jetty:run
## Testing
* Navigate to indexer service's root folder and run:
 
```bash
mvn clean install   
```

* If you wish to see the coverage report then go to testing/target/site/jacoco-aggregate and open index.html

* If you wish to build the project without running tests

```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

After configuring your environment as specified above, you can follow these steps to build and run the application. These steps should be invoked from the *repository root.*

```bash
cd provider/indexer-gcp/ && mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Testing
Navigate to indexer service's root folder and run all the tests:

```bash
# build + install integration test core
$ (cd testing/indexer-test-core/ && mvn clean install)
```

### Running E2E Tests 

This section describes how to run cloud OSDU E2E tests.

### Anthos test configuration:
[Anthos service configuration ](docs/anthos/README.md)
### GCP test configuration:
[Gcp service configuration ](docs/gcp/README.md)

## Deployment

* Data-Lake Indexer Google Cloud Endpoints on App Engine Flex environment
  * Edit the app.yaml
    * Open the [app.yaml](indexer/src/main/appengine/app.yaml) file in editor, and replace the YOUR-PROJECT-ID `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` line with Google Cloud Platform project Id. Also update `AUTHORIZE_API`, `CRON_JOB_IP`, `LEGAL_HOSTNAME`, `REGION` and `SECURITY_HTTPS_CERTIFICATE_TRUST` based on your deployment
 
  * Deploy
    ```sh
    mvn appengine:deploy -pl org.opengroup.osdu.indexer:indexer -amd
    ```

  * If you wish to deploy the search service without running tests
    ```sh
    mvn appengine:deploy -pl org.opengroup.osdu.indexer:indexer -amd -DskipTests
    ```

or
* Google Documentation: https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/deploying-builds/deploy-appengine

#### Memory Store (Redis Instance) Setup

Create a new Standard tier Redis instance on the ***service project***

The Redis instance must be created under the same region with the App Engine application which needs to access it.

```bash
    gcloud beta redis instances create redis-cache-search --size=10 --region=<service-deployment-region> --zone=<service-deployment-zone> --tier=STANDARD
```

## Entitlements groups
Storage service account should have entitlements groups listed below:
- service.entitlements.user
- users
- service.schema-service.viewers
- service.storage.admin
- service.search.admin
